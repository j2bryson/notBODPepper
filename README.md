# BODPepper
23 Dec 2021

This README is a stub. This is a project directed by Joanna Bryson to extend her Behaviour Oriented Design development methodology to the SoftBank pepper robot platfrom. 
Most of the initial development on this project has been funded by AXA Research as a part of a fellowship to Prof. Bryson recognising her work in AI ethics.

BOD is a systems engineering approach to creating real time, including "human like" AI. As such, it also provides transparency.

Ultimately the files here should form a single "behaviour library." Different programs / personalities for a pepper robot are developed by specifying a set of prioirties via a POSH plan. POSH plans are very much like Behavior Trees, they may even be the academic precedent to Behavior Trees (if so, uncited.)

Presently, the files are divided into 3 subdirectories because there were three masters students at University of Bath developing the code when the project was derailed (like many things) by COVID in March of 2020.

A linked project provided by StormUK, pepper, provides the POSH software for running these files.  You will also need to update your pepper robot to the most recent version of Android, see further the StormUK repository.
